# Digital FIR (Finite Impulse Response) Filter in Verilog

## 📘 Project Overview

This project implements a *Digital FIR (Finite Impulse Response) Filter* using *Verilog HDL*, designed for real-time signal processing applications. FIR filters are widely used in digital communications, audio processing, and embedded systems due to their stability and linear-phase response. 

The goal of this project is to design a basic yet functional FIR filter, simulate its behavior with input signals, and analyze the output performance. The implementation includes:
- FIR filter design (fir_filter.v)
- Testbench for simulation (tb_fir_filter.v)
- Simulation waveforms using GTKWave
- Performance analysis (latency, throughput, output characteristics)


## 🔧 FIR Filter Characteristics

- *Filter Type*: Low-pass (based on symmetric coefficients)
- *Filter Order*: 4-tap (can be increased easily)
- *Arithmetic*: Fixed-point signed 8-bit input, 16-bit output
